Looked at different IR LEDs that could fit my use case. I ended up on using 8 of the APTD3216F3C-P22, which should fit nicely into the power budget of 5W

I also designed the PCB, which needed some kind of 90 degree connector. I initially came up with this design:

However, I realized it's really jank and instead decided to switch it out for a 90 degree pin header.

I tweaked the design, sourced parts on digikey, and worked on the bom.
Also cadded a case:
